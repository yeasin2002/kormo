# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Express.js backend to NestJS while maintaining all current functionality including DrizzleORM database operations, Better-Auth authentication, oRPC API endpoints, and existing business logic. The migration should preserve data models, authentication flows, and API contracts while leveraging NestJS's modular architecture and dependency injection system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure DrizzleORM in the NestJS backend, so that I can maintain the same database operations and schema as the existing Express backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the NestJS application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a PostgreSQL connection using the same database credentials as the Express backend
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use the existing Drizzle schema files without modification
3. WHEN migrations are run THEN the system SHALL use the same migration files and configuration as the Express backend
4. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and prevent application startup
5. WHEN the DrizzleORM client is injected THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe database operations with the existing schema

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Better-Auth with the NestJS backend, so that authentication flows work seamlessly across web and mobile platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Better-Auth is configured THEN the system SHALL use the existing auth schema and database adapter configuration
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL maintain the same session management and cookie handling as the Express backend
3. WHEN authentication requests are made THEN the system SHALL support the same trusted origins and CORS configuration
4. WHEN the Expo plugin is used THEN the system SHALL maintain mobile app authentication compatibility
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with consistent formatting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing API endpoints to NestJS controllers, so that all current functionality is preserved with improved structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are migrated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same URL paths and HTTP methods as the Express backend
2. WHEN oRPC endpoints are converted THEN the system SHALL preserve type safety and validation logic
3. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same request/response formats and error handling
4. WHEN middleware is applied THEN the system SHALL implement equivalent functionality using NestJS guards, interceptors, and pipes
5. IF API calls fail THEN the system SHALL return consistent error responses matching the Express backend format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper NestJS module structure, so that the application follows best practices for maintainability and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN the system SHALL organize functionality into logical feature modules (auth, companies, tools, etc.)
2. WHEN services are implemented THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection for database clients and business logic
3. WHEN configuration is managed THEN the system SHALL use NestJS ConfigModule for environment variables and settings
4. WHEN the application structure is reviewed THEN the system SHALL follow NestJS conventions for file organization and naming
5. IF modules have dependencies THEN the system SHALL properly import and export required providers and services

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain existing database schemas and business logic, so that no data or functionality is lost during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the companies schema is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing fields, types, and constraints
2. WHEN the auth schema is used THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing user accounts and sessions
3. WHEN business logic is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing validation rules and data processing
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same transaction handling and error management
5. IF schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL use the existing migration system without breaking existing data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure proper logging and monitoring, so that the NestJS backend provides the same observability as the Express backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL implement request logging equivalent to the Express Morgan middleware
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them using the same Winston configuration and format
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request details, response times, and status codes
4. WHEN log files are created THEN the system SHALL use the same daily rotation and storage configuration
5. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating while attempting to restore logging functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain development and build scripts, so that the development workflow remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development mode is started THEN the system SHALL provide hot reload functionality equivalent to the Express backend
2. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL produce optimized production builds
3. WHEN database commands are run THEN the system SHALL support the same Drizzle CLI operations (push, studio, generate, migrate)
4. WHEN code quality checks are performed THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing linting and formatting tools
5. IF build processes fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
