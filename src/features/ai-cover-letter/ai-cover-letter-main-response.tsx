        ðŸ§ƒ Minimal Cover Letter (To the Point) Hey Fahim, Iâ€™m Yeasinâ€”a student
        and software engineer who loves working with JavaScript frameworks like
        Nuxt and building real-world products. I saw your opening for a
        part-time Full Stack Dev and itâ€™s exactly the kind of opportunity Iâ€™m
        looking for. Iâ€™ve built full stack projects (like a hotel management
        system using Nuxt and MongoDB) and have solid experience across frontend
        and backend. Iâ€™m familiar with Next.js and can get up to speed fast. 20
        hours a week sounds perfect and Iâ€™m pumped to contribute to a startup
        MVP. Attaching my resume. Would love to chat more! Best, Yeasin
      </p>
